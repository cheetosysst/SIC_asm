# SIC_asm

Assignment for system program class. This is a SIC/XE assembler written in C++.

It's not great, the code is a mess, but it does work.

I'm releasing it, so maybe someone can take inspiration from it.

Make sure you compile it with GNU's g++, or you'll have to replace bits/stdc+.h manually.
